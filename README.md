## 📝 Introduction  
Customer feedback is essential for restaurants to improve their services. This project utilizes NLP techniques to analyze restaurant reviews and determine whether they reflect a positive or negative sentiment. This analysis can help restaurant owners better understand customer satisfaction and improve their services.

---

## 📊 Dataset  
- **Source**: [Mention the dataset source, e.g., Kaggle, UCI, or custom dataset].  
- **Structure**: The dataset contains two columns:  
  - `Review`: The text of the customer review.  
  - `Sentiment`: The label (Positive/Negative).  

---

## 🚀 Project Workflow  
1. **Data Collection**: Importing and loading the dataset.  
2. **Data Cleaning**: Removing noise such as stopwords, punctuation, and special characters.  
3. **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.  
4. **Feature Extraction**: Using techniques like Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, or word embeddings.  
5. **Model Training**: Training machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or deep learning models).  
6. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
